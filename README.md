# Loan-default-prediction

## Problem definition
A major proportion of retail bank profit comes from interests in the form of home loans. These loans
are borrowed by regular income/high-earning customers. Banks are most fearful of defaulters, as
bad loans (NPA) usually eat up a major chunk of their profits. Therefore, it is important for banks to
be judicious while approving loans for their customer base.
The approval process for the loans is multifaceted. Through this process, the bank tries to check the
creditworthiness of the applicant on the basis of a manual study of various aspects of the
application. The entire process is not only effort-intensive but also prone to wrong
judgment/approval owing to human error and biases.
There have been attempts by many banks to automate this process by using heuristics. But with the
advent of data science and machine learning, the focus has shifted to building machines that can
learn this approval process and make it free of biases and more efficient. At the same time, one
important thing to keep in mind is to make sure that the machine does not learn the biases that
previously crept in because of the human approval process.

## The objective
Build a classification model to predict clients who are likely to default on their loan and give
recommendations to the bank on the important features to consider while approving a loan.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- Anaconda 
- (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imblearn, xgboost)
